## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases and methods to access the databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a basic functionality that makes BambangShop work: ability to create, read, and delete `Product`s.
This repository already contains a functioning `Product` model, repository, service, and controllers that you can try right away.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement another feature: `Notification`.
This feature will notify creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, to external subscribers that are interested of a certain product type.
The subscribers are another Rocket instances, so the notification will be sent using HTTP POST request to each subscriber's `receive notification` address.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Publisher" folder.
This Postman collection also contains endpoints that you need to implement later on (the `Notification` feature).

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL="http://localhost:8000"
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable              | type   | description                                                |
    |-----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where this publisher instance can be accessed. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Publisher) Reflections

#### Reflection Publisher-1
1. In the Observer pattern diagram explained by the Head First Design Pattern book, Subscriber is defined as an interface. Explain based on your understanding of Observer design patterns, do we still need an interface (or **trait** in Rust) in this BambangShop case, or a single Model **struct** is enough?

    *In the Observer design pattern, an interface (or trait in Rust) is typically used to define the methods or services that observers will implement. However, in the case of BambangShop, the use of an Interface or Trait may not be necessary as there isn't much variation in the expected behavior of observers. Instead, a single Model struct that encompasses data about observers and the necessary behavior to notify them would suffice. Therefore, in this case, using a single Model struct for observers is adequate.*

2. **id** in **Program** and **url** in **Subscriber** is intended to be unique. Explain based on your understanding, is using **Vec** (list) sufficient or using **DashMap** (map/dictionary) like we currently use is necessary for this case?

    *While using a Vec (list) may be sufficient if we only need to store unique IDs or URLs of subscribers, employing DashMap (map/dictionary) as currently utilized is recommended. DashMap offers advantages in terms of speed of access and data manipulation. With DashMap, we can easily check the existence of IDs or URLs, and swiftly access or update existing entries. This can lead to more efficiency and better performance as the application scales.*

3. When programming using Rust, we are enforced by rigorous compiler constraints to make a thread-safe program. In the case of the List of Subscribers (**SUBSCRIBERS**) static variable, we used the **DashMap** external library for **thread safe HashMap**. Explain based on your understanding of design patterns, do we still need **DashMap** or we can implement Singleton pattern instead?

    *In the Singleton Pattern, a class has only one instance throughout the application. In this scenario, using DashMap for the SUBSCRIBERS static variable is the preferable choice as it allows access to the same data structure from anywhere in the application, ensuring concurrent safety. DashMap provides a robust solution for concurrency safety in a multithreaded environment, which is crucial in Rust programming. Although Singleton pattern can be implemented in Rust, it might not be necessary in this case as DashMap effectively provides the required functionality while maintaining shared safety. Therefore, the use of DashMap is the appropriate choice for the SUBSCRIBERS static variable in the BambangShop application.*
